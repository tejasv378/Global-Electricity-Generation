## Description
This report enables the visualization of global electricity generation across the world for years spanning 2000-2023. This includes per capita electricity generation measured in Kilowatt-hours as well as the percentage of electricity generation amongst different energy sources including Hydro, Solar, Wind, Nuclear, Coal, Gas, Fossil Fuels, and Non-Fossil Fuels. 

Users can easily navigate between different report pages by clicking on the page navigation icon at the top left corner of each page. Once this is clicked the page navigation bar becomes visible. Ensure that you hold down the Control key both while clicking on the navigation icon as well as while selecting the page you want to navigate to. (Note: This feature is implemented through usage of buttons and bookmarks).

This can be used by various stakeholders including Energy Policy Makers, Government Agencies, Environmental NGO's, and Climate Change Advocates to help guide them with key decisions that can make life better for both our planet as well as society. This may include identifying areas/regions needing more investments in electricity, especially in renewable sources to reduce the rate at which global warming is accelerating. Additionally, this can raise our overall awareness about the still desparate need to drastically cut down on fossil fuel dependency.    

### Each page consists of the following visuals: 
- Slicer: Allows user to select specific year or year interval for data analysis

- Shape Map: Depicts electricity generation distribution amongst different countries during specified time period. Consists of colors along a gradient where Red = Worst, Yellow = Neutral, Green = Best
(Note: For Coal, Gas and Fossil Fuel pages Red = High %, Yellow = Medium %, and Green = Low % ; For other pages Red = Low %, Yellow = Medium %, and Green = High %)

- Clustered Bar Chart: Ranks electricity generation distribution for different countries during specified period. Calculated measure '[source] Country Rank' created to determine ranking

- Line Chart Electricity by Year and Economy Type: Displays relationship between Country Economy Type and Source Electricity Generation for specified time interval. (Note: Economy types include high-income, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low income)

- Line Chart Electricity by Year and Country: Displays relationship between Country and Source Electricity Generation for specified time interval. (Note: The line chart initially shows data for all countries combined. Selecting a specific country from the Shape Map will filter data for that country on the line chart for the specified time interval

Note: For Fossil Fuel Electricity, data is calculated by summing up the totals of Coal, and Gas Electricity.

Note: For Non-Fossil Fuel Electricity, data is calculated by summing up the totals of Hydro, Solar, Wind, and Nuclear Electricity.
